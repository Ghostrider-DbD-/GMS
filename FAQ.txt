Core Mission System.

The core mission system is configured to run 4 different classes of mission (Blue, Red, Green and Orange) simultaneously.
Reducing value for 	...\custom_serer\configs\blck_configs.sqf\blck_maxSpawnedMissions will reduce the number of missions running on the server.

General settings include the ability set whether and how messages to players regarding missions spawned or completed are displayed,
	whether and how messages to players regarding killed AI are displayed
	
	Number of AI groups;
	Number of AI per group;
	AI skills;
	Number and type of static weapons;
	Number and type of armed vehicle patrols.
	Presence of AI helicopter patrols.
	Whether such patrols drop AI reinforcements.

	Loot can also be configured for each mission class. You can modify the number of weapons, magazines, items, construction materials, etc. 
	You can also adjust the choices for each of these types of items.
	The equipment selected for each class of mission can also be specified.
	Whether kills by guns mounted on vehicles are to be penalized (gunes that are prohobited are listed in blck_config.sys).
	Whether to spawn a smoking wreck near the mission to be used as a visual landmark.
	Whether to spawn mines (recommended only when no vehcle patrols are spawned).

Where possible, I have tried group weapons based on desirability from low rank (5.56 ammo) to high rank (7.6 caliber or larger, large bore sniper, heavy LMG) then combine these groups to define parameters as needed.

The missions themselves are spawned from templates which can be used to define:
 the messages sent to players; 
 text used to label the mark
 type of marker used to label the map
 number of AI groups and number of AI
 (optional) loot chest positions and loot to be loaded
 type and location of any objects, buildings, or other entities that give the mission character
 number and (optional) locations of static weapons
 number of vehicle patrols
 
 To create and run new missions simply: 
	layout an AI base in the Arma 3 editor, 
	export the base as an .sqf
	Define the above parameters (nu. AI groups, No AI, etc)
	add this information to the mission template and modify any messages accordingly
	Add the name of the file (e.g., "newAImission" to the list of missions to be spawned of that class in ...\custom)server\missions\GMS_missionLists.sqf
	Repack your custom_server.pbo

Performance considerations.
At present, missions do not actually spawn objects or players untill a player is within the trigger distance (1000 M). 
Hence, performance penalties should be modest to none until players engage a mission. 
There is some performance penalty to having a lot of dead AI on the server, or a lot of spawned objects used for scenery at AI missions. Hence, these are deleted after a certain time.

Static Mission System (WIP).

Additional Modules Available:

1. Time Acceleration

This provides an optional ability to accelerate time by user-specified factors.
The time acceleration can be specified for night, daytime and dusk.
Variables controlling the time acceleration module are located in ...\custom_server\configs\blck_configs.sqf and are:

	blck_useTimeAcceleration = false; // When true, time acceleration will be periodically updated based on amount of daylight at that time according to the values below.
	blck_timeAccelerationDay = 1;  // Daytime time accelearation
	blck_timeAccelerationDusk = 4; // Dawn/dusk time accelearation
	blck_timeAccelerationNight = 8;  // Nighttim time acceleration	
	
Note that map/mod specific settings can be specified in blck_custom_config.sqf if that is helpful.

2. Map Addons

This module allows you to load map-addons (custom bases, enhancements to villages or towns, ATMs at traders etc) but to do so in a way that is map and mod-specific.
I use it to manage the map addons we run on multiple different Arma servers.
It is designed to permit you to place files in subdirectories of the MapAddons folder to simplyfy organization of the various files.
You can enable/disable the use of map-addons with the following variable found in ...\custom_server\configs\blck_configs:

blck_spawnMapAddons = false; 

You can define which addons you wish to load in ...\custom_server\MapAddons\MapAddons_init.sqf.

3. Static Loot System

This module spawns loot crates at pre-specified locations on the ground, inside buildings or on roofs.
It is designed to function in conjunction with the Map Addons module if you wish it to.
It was derived from the loot crate spawner originally released by DarthRogue but has been extensively revised.
One enhancement is that I have written the code so that you do not need to sort items by there arma type (weapon, magazine, item).
In any event, it is a great tool for placing loot chests at AI strongholds or static missions.

Some basic features are:
Crates can be spawned at precise locations with / without a nearby smoking wreck to mark their location (which crates an apololyptic feel).
Crates can be loaded with one of 3 different loadouts (add more if you like) which can be specified or randomly determined.
If the number of possible spawn locations is greater than the number of crates to spawned, spawn locations will be randomly chosen giving some variation to your mission.

The static loot crate spawner is enabled/disable by changing the following variable in ...\custom_server\configs\blck_configs.sqf

	blck_spawnStaticLootCrates = false;
	
I wrote the crate spawner in a way that helps me manage static loot crates across multiple maps and mods. 
The configuration files for Epoch or Exile give examples of how to implement the system.
